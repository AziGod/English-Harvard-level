Sophia integrates several cutting-edge technologies that enable her to simulate human behavior:

1. Physical structure and face:
   - Her skin is made from a patented material called Frubber ("flesh rubber"),
    this material permit to Sophia to have a facial expressions similar to the humans.
   - Her eyes are equipped with high-resolution cameras that track gaze
 	and detect the facial expressions of people she interacts with.

2. Artificial Intelligence:
   - Sophia is powered by advanced AI that uses natural language
    processing to communicate to the human.
   - She learns continuously through machine learning algorithms,
	improving her responses and interactions over time.

3. Sensors and movement:
   - Sophia is fitted with sensors she can detect sounds, and recognize motion.
   - Her motorized head, arms, and hands allow her to move smoothly and
    give us the illusion to talk with a real human.

Sophia operates through a combination of cloud-based AI and onboard software:
   - When someone speaks to Sophia, her sensors pick up audio and visual data
	These inputs are sent to a remote server, where AI algorithms process the information.

   - Sophia can formulate context-aware answers by combining pre-programmed databases with generative AI models.
	This allows her to engage in conversations that feel natural and dynamic.

Sophia was designed with multiple purposes in mind:
    1. Education and awareness:
     She participates in confersences, interviews, and panels,
     speaking on topics ranging from robotics to societal issues.

    2. Social interaction:
     Sophia is a platform for exploring how humans and machines can connect on a deeper level.
    3. Research and development:
     Sophia serves as a testing ground for advancing technologies in AI and human-robot interaction.
