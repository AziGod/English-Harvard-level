    When : Sophia was created on 19 april 2015.
    What : Sophia is an humanoid robot that can mimic human expressions 
            and interact wth people in a human-like way.
    Why : Hanson Robotics created Sophia to improve robotics and explore the field
            of human-robot interaction
    Who : Hanson Robotics is the company that created Sophia. 
        David Hanson is the founder of Hanson Robotics. 
        He created Sophia with the goal of developing social robots that can interact with people in human-like ways.
        He has a PhD in interactive Arts and Engineering from the University of Texas.

    What is Artificial Intelligence ?
    The term AI is usually used to describe algorithms that exhibit human-like intelligence, such as the ability to solve logical problems or understand languages.

    What is a Robot?
    A robot is a device that can perform pre-programmed tasks, such as moving a package or cleaning a room. In most cases, robots cannot adapt to their environment. They are designed for specific tasks in environments like a warehouse or a kitchen.

    Key Difference:
    AI is software, while robots are hardware. Sometimes, scientists try to blend the two.
    This is the case with Sophia, as we will see later in the presentation.

    The main challenge is that human conversation isn't always precise or direct. 
    Often, we use unsaid words or the wrong words, yet we still understand each other 
    because of our emotional intelligence or because we know the other person.

    For Sophia to speak with a human, she must understand emotions and be able to express her own. 
    This is where the interaction between AI and robotics becomes necessary. 
    Although AI is great for understanding speech and communication, robotics faces much greater challenges 
    in identifying and replicating facial expressions.

    In brief, emotions are the difficult factor.
