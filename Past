Intro:
Good morning/afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Let me start by introducing my coworkers and myself.
I'm here with Thibault and Cl√©ment, and I'm Armand.
We're going to present to you a humanoid robot called 'Sophia'.

We've divided our presentation into 3 main parts:
First, we'll be looking at the past, second the present and third the future.


Past:
Hansen Robotics has released Sophia in 2015.
They are a company based in Hong-Kong which create humanoid robots.
Their first famous robot is called "Albert Einstein HUBO" created in 2005, since then
a few has follow like Han, a robot specialized in facial expressions, or Diego, a robot made
to simulate the movements and behavior of a human child.

Their objective is to build these robots for the research and development towards robots and AI, they are mainly tools.
Another aim of their activities is to be seen as a form of art to observe how humans react to those innovations.

Sophia was created to make human-robot interactions as natural and empathetic as possible.
